## Introduction

Our project aims to empower visually impaired individuals by integrating object detection, voice-guided navigation, and essential functionalities to offer unparalleled autonomy and safety. The system employs an ESP32 microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, and Bluetooth connectivity for seamless navigation and obstacle detection.

## Requirements

- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- IP Camera
- DHT Sensor
- Speaker
- Tactile Switch
- XAMPP for server-side operations
- Mobile application developed using Flutter

## Installation

1. Install XAMPP.
2. Clone the project repository to the root of the XAMPP server.
3. Open the project in XAMPP.
4. Import the SQL file from the `database` folder into the XAMPP server.
5. Open a browser and navigate to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080).
6. Ensure all required hardware components are connected and configured as per the project documentation.
7. Hurray! The project is now running.

## System Overview

The system integrates various technologies to provide a comprehensive navigation assistance solution:

### Hardware Components

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Acts as the main controller.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Detects obstacles.
- **IP Camera**: Captures real-time images for object and facial recognition.
- **DHT Sensor**: Monitors environmental conditions.
- **Speaker**: Provides auditory feedback.
- **Tactile Switch**: User input for different functions.

### Software Components

- **Python**: Programming language for developing the core functionalities.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.
- **TensorFlow Keras**: Used for sentiment analysis.
- **YOLO**: Algorithm for object detection.
- **Arduino**: For programming the ESP microcontroller.
- **Flutter**: For mobile application development.

## Features

### Obstacle Detection

Ultrasonic sensors connected to the ESP32 detect obstacles and provide immediate audio feedback through a speaker.

### Object Recognition

A deep learning model identifies objects in real-time images captured by the camera. Recognized objects are announced to the user via text-to-speech functionality.

### Facial Recognition and Sentiment Analysis

The camera captures facial features, and a trained neural network recognizes faces and analyzes expressions to provide emotional insights.

### Weather Reporting

A DHT sensor monitors environmental conditions and provides verbal updates on the weather, helping users make informed navigation decisions.

### Emergency Assistance

Users can trigger a distress signal via Bluetooth, which communicates with a mobile application and a XAMPP server running dedicated algorithms for object detection and face recognition.
